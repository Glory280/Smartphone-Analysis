# Smartphone-Analysis

### About
This project analyzes a comprehensive smartphone dataset to uncover insights about various smartphone features, their prices, and other key specifications. By utilizing SQL, we answered several questions about the dataset, performed data manipulations, and conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA). The insights derived from this analysis can guide consumers, researchers, and manufacturers in understanding market trends and feature correlations.

### Purpose of The Project
The primary purpose of this project is to analyze a smartphone dataset to answer specific questions regarding smartphone features, prices, and capabilities. By leveraging SQL for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis, the project aims to provide insights that could be valuable for consumers, manufacturers, and market analysts. This analysis also helps in understanding the relationships between different smartphone attributes and their impact on the overall market.

### Analysis List
1. Top 10 Smartphone Models by Price
2. Brands Offering Smartphones with 5G Connectivity
3. Count of Smartphones with NFC Capability
4. Average Battery Capacity of Smartphones
5. Smartphones with Processor Speed Greater than 2.5 GHz
6. Total Cost of Purchasing All Smartphones with 5G Connectivity
7. Creation of a New Column for High Refresh Rate Display (> 90 Hz)
8. Total RAM Capacity Across All Smartphone Models
9. Conversion of Battery Capacity from mAh to Wh
10. Creation of a Full Processor Specification Column

### Approach Used
● Data Extraction: SQL queries were used to extract specific information from the
dataset.
● Data Manipulation: Various SQL commands were employed to manipulate and
create new data columns, such as converting battery capacity and calculating total
costs.
● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): SQL was used to explore and visualize data
distributions, correlations, and relationships between different smartphone
features.
● Logical Analysis: Advanced SQL queries helped identify the features contributing
most to price, and explore relationships between different smartphone attributes.

### Data Exploration
1. Distribution of Smartphone Prices: Analysis of how smartphone prices are spread
across the dataset to understand the pricing tiers.
2. Correlation Between Price and Rating: Investigation of whether higher-priced
smartphones tend to have better ratings.
3. Average Battery Capacity by Brand: Comparison of battery capacities across
different brands to identify any significant differences.
4. Most Common Operating System: Identification of the predominant operating
system in the smartphone market.
5. Relationship Between Processor Speed and Number of Cores: Exploration of how
processor speed varies with the number of cores in smartphones.
6. Feature Contribution to Price: Analysis to determine which features (processor
speed, RAM, etc.) most significantly affect smartphone prices.
7. Battery Capacity and Fast-Charging Capability: Examination of whether there is a
link between battery capacity and the availability of fast-charging.
8. Price Comparison of 5G vs. Non-5G Smartphones: Analysis to see if 5G-enabled
smartphones are generally more expensive.
9. Impact of Rear Cameras on Rating: Exploration of how the number of rear cameras
affects the overall rating of smartphones.
10. Influence of IR Blaster on Popularity: Investigation of whether the presence of an
IR blaster affects the popularity of a smartphone model.
